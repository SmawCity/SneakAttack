# Overview

This is a program that uses random number generation and loops to allow the user to simulate rolling large amounts of dice. This is intended to expedite the process of rolling large numbers of dice, such as when playing Dungeons & Dragons. The user is given options to do a standard sneak attack, a custom roll, or an option that allows them to roll the sneak attack damage for a pre-existing character with several more complexities than your standard rogue.
